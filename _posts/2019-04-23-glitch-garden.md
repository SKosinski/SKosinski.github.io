My largest 2D game so far. It's a representative of a tower defence genre. Buy fortifications or defenders and destroy everything coming your way, but never forget about maintaining good economy! Think fast and defend your base!
Key Features: First animations, Snap to grid mechanic, Many canvases in one scene, Difficulty and Global Volume settings, Recource System
Game was based on a udemy tutorial "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D" created by gamedev.tv.
Not intended for commercial use.
