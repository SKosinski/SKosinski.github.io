My largest 2D game so far. It's a representative of a tower defence genre. Buy fortifications or defenders and destroy everything coming your way, but never forget about maintaining good economy! Think fast and defend your base!<br>
<br>
Game was based on a udemy tutorial "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D" created by gamedev.tv.<br>
Not intended for commercial use.<br>
<br>
Key Features: 
* First animations
* Snap to grid mechanic
* Many canvases in one scene
* Difficulty and Global Volume settings
* Recource System<br>
