My first 3D project made in Unity. It's a simple arcade prototype, in which your goal is to reach the end of the level. Become a pilot of a rocket, that is suprisingly difficult to manage! <br> 
<br>
Game was based on a udemy tutorial "Complete C# Unity Developer 3D" created by gamedev.tv.<br>
Not intended for commercial use.<br>

Key Features:
* 2D movement in 3D world
* First 3D levels and assets
* 3D particle effects
* Ligtning the scene
