My first 3D project made in Unity. It's a simple arcade prototype, in which your goal is to reach the end of the level. Become a pilot of a rocket, that is suprisingly difficult to manage!
Key Features: 2D movement in 3D world, First 3D levels and assets, 3D particle effects, Ligtning the scene
Game was based on a udemy tutorial "Complete C# Unity Developer 3D" created by gamedev.tv.
