My first 2D game made in Unity. It's a simple arkanoid, where you goal is... to score a goal! Destroy all blocks on the field, beat the keeper and put the ball in between two goalposts.<br>
<br>
Key Features: 
* Making first levels
* Creating UI
* Hooking up Sound Effects
* First full game cycle <br>
<br>
Game was based on a udemy tutorial "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D" created by gamedev.tv.<br>
Not intended for commercial use.
