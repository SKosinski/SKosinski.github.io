My first 2D game made in Unity. It's a simple arkanoid, where you goal is... to score a goal! Destroy all blocks on the field, beat the keeper and put the ball in between two goalposts.
Key Features: making first levels, creating UI, hooking up Sound Effects, first full game cycle
Game was based on a udemy tutorial "Complete C# Unity Developer 2D" created by gamedev.tv.
Not intended for commercial use.
